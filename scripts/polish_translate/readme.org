* Translation

** v1 
Copy and paste the typst file to GPT 5, ask it to translate:

#+begin_quote
The following Typst file has most of its content in Polish. I want an English equivalent of the file. Keep all words that are already in English in English (especially the markup for typst).
#+end_quote

*Issues*
- The original (pandoc-converted) typst file does not have bibliographic references properly done. A pre-processing stage that polishes the polish form and separates out a 'references.bib' file would probably be appropriate.
- Sometimes the Typst syntax is not properly preserved by GPT.
