= Proof by contradiction

Let us more carefully examine the argument in #emph[Capital] to observe how it forecloses modern freedom through the movement of its forms.
Marx's method comprises what I will call (and elaborate in future chapters) a #strong[critique of calculus].
His critique pertains not only to the capitalist calculus of value with reference to labor, I argue, but also to the ontological sensibility of how modern calculus as a method locates truth more generally.
This critique reveals a commitment to the ontological importance of #emph[contradiction] in the appearance of truth.
In recognizing that Marx's philosophical standpoint sits squarely #emph[in] history rather than outside of it, Postone identifies the method of #emph[Capital] as an #strong[immanent critique] of economic rationality.
It starts from and stays within the conceptual world of economic axioms, and proceeds by revealing the sites of logical contradiction in its discursive edifice.

In Volume I, Marx argues that capital reproduces itself without any apparent need for human labor, despite the labor-power of the worker's transformation into variable capital being absolutely essential to the manufacture of surplus-value (an argument laid out in chapter
21).
#footnote[All chapter number references in this chapter, unless otherwise stated, refer to the 2024 English translation of Volume I @marxCapitalCritiquePolitical2024.]
Capital appears to produce value as if it were a machine, driven by some motive force that is not necessarily human labor, such as steam or horse-power.
But this appearance contradicts the logical form of value as it is chiefly unfolded with reference to money, labor-time, and surplus value in chapters 1 through 6, as this logic holds that surplus-value can only be expropriated from a particular kind of of commodity, namely labor-power.
The constitutive distortion between human and machine at stake in this self-valorizing appearance of capital is produced by a series of successive contradictory concepts, each one unfolding from the contradiction located in the last.
#footnote[This unfolding is sometimes referred to as Marx's dialectical method.
I avoid this terminology here because, as Michael Heinrich notes in his introduction to #emph[Capital], the 'dialectical' qualification has historically been used as much to mystify Marx's deep commitment to logic, rationality and contradiction as it has to clarify it @heinrichIntroductionThreeVolumes2012[ pp.36-38].
My positioning of Marx's method in #emph[Capital] as a prototype of a critique of calculus can, however, be understood as an attempt to disentangle what is mathematically at stake in dialectics as a modus operandi in philosophy.]

Let us begin, then, where Marx does in chapter 1, with the concept of the commodity {#emph[die Waare]}.
We will notate the commodity as $C$ and take it to mean, following Marx, a good that is conceptually exchangeable for another good.
There is nothing distinctly physical about a commodity: it is #quote[an external object {#emph[ein äusserer Gegenstand]}-- a thing whose properties satisfy human wants or needs {#emph[menschliche Bedürfnisse]} of whatever kind {#emph[irgend einer Art]}] @marxCapitalCritiquePolitical2024[p.13].
The German term for object used here, #emph[Gegenstand], refers in the vocabulary of German idealism (a core component of Marx's philosophical education) to something that 'stands against' {#emph[Gegen]-#emph[stand];} the perceiving subject, i.e. an object as it appears to consciousness.
#footnote[Marx's qualified use of the term #emph[Gegenstandlichkeit] in #emph[Capital] to describe the spectral thingliness of the commodity is often translated into English as simply 'objectivity'.
This translation obscures the nuance of the term, which is best thought about with the decomposition of the base term #emph[Gegenstand] in mind, i.e. as 'standing-against-(the-subject)-liness' or perhaps as 'objectified-liness'.
Frank Engster provides a concise explanation of the nuance of this term's implications in Marx's philosophical context in @foreignobjektFrankEngsterBlind2021[ 24:28-25:00].]
The adjective #emph[äusserer] is translated as external, as it refers in the same philosophical tradition to a space outside of the perceiving subject, rather than an internal abstraction that is private to the perceiver's personal mind.
Thus the commodity is an object-impression perceived by an observer that is not just a private hallucination, but rather is a #emph[shared] concept, and thus has the sense of being external.

The commodity is not limited to objects in the colloquial sense, as it is a notion that can apply, as Marx specifies in the quotation above, to anything that satisfies a need or desire of any kind.
A service, therefore, can be a commodity, as can something visually invisible but sensible in some other way, such as a smell or a sound, as can apparently 'immaterial' things such as software.
What commodifies an object in the terms of Marx's argument is its thinkability as exchangeable, its acquisition of exchange-value, its expression or #emph[naming] as a representative quantity in the circuit of social value.
A software company that sells a subscription service is producing commodities at this conceptual level just as much as an steel factory that is processing iron and carbon in a furnace.
Commodity production does not refer exclusively to the more palpably material processes that we associate with the industrial revolution, but to giving of quantities to objects that are then taken to express their value:

#lemma[
The commodity is the name of the moment in which an object is made conceptually exchangeable by means of a quantity that is taken to express its social value.
] <lem:commodity>

The misunderstanding of a commodity as exclusively a physical product that can change hands gives rise to other misunderstandings, such as the idea that capital no longer structures daily life in our present conditions of exchange.
Jodi Dean has recently put forward, for example, building on prior arguments from Mackenzie Wark and Yanis Varoufakis, that capital is dying and threatens to be replaced by a new-- and even more life-threatening-- paradigm of sociality that could be called 'neofeudalism' @deanCapitalsGraveNeofeudalism2025@warkCapitalDeadThis2021@varoufakisTechnofeudalismWhatKilled2024. The evidence of capital's moribund state, according to Dean, is the preponderance of services such as those provided by Uber drivers, which are taken to represent a form of exchange that is no longer the commodity.
As explained above, however, services such as Uber rides and those in the so-called can be treated as commodities just as much as tangibly graspable products such as steel bars and paper clips.
Thus to say that the salience of Uber as a major player in the economy is evidence of the decline of commodification is to misunderstand the generality of the commodity concept as Marx presents it; i.e. as any 'thing' that is thinkable as quantifiably exchangeable.
If the commodity and the capital-logic that follows from it are on their deathbeds, as Marx theorized them, it cannot be on sole account of a booming service economy: for services can be commodities, too, when their value is expressed in a given quantity such as a dollar amount.

There is nothing inherently un-commodity-like, then, about either services or software as such.
The consequences of this point regarding how Marx helps us to understand the structure of 'information society' will be explored in later chapters, but let us return now to the commodity's conceptual unfolding at its most elementary.
The commodity is any object that is rendered in thought as a #emph[quantity] (as possessing an exchange-value).
There are objects in the world that we use in our day-to-day lives; but if there is no way to imagine that object of thought as exchangeable with some other thought-object, then it is not a commodity in the sense in which Marx is interested in that term.
It is the commodity concept's inherent exchangeability that Marx logically develops into a notion of value.
Value is the consistency through which it becomes possible to think one commodity as exchangeable for another, the (subjective) quality of a thing that recognizes it may satisfy a person's want, need, or desire.
In order for commodity exchange to be sensible, value must take a material form in the world, which is precisely what gives rise to money {#emph[das Geld]}, which we will notate as $M$.
#footnote[Note that I have translated the original German symbols $W$ {#emph[Waare]} and $G$ {#emph[Geld]} into $C$ (commodity) and $M$ (money) for the convenience of the English reader, following the standard convention.]
Money is the objective measure of the value in commodity exchange.
The process of exchange that constitutes capital is thus often notated as $M arrow.r C arrow.r M'$, a process that we will unpack in more detail shortly.
The $'$ in this formula can be pronounced 'prime', and it indicates the surplus-value that accrues to the capitalist after his money has been valorized in its circulation as a commodity.
Exchange in the mode of production called capital is the ongoing transformation of these two concepts, the commodity and money, into each other.
A commodity is exchanged for money, so that that money can be exchanged for (other) commodities.

Each of these concepts, money and the commodity, logically implies the other.
There can be no money, which emerges as a quantitative measure of value in the commodity, without the commodity.
Vice versa, without the complementary concept of money, the commodity would be incomplete as a concept.
Commodities would have no quantified measure of value, and so would have to individually be thought as exchangeable for a concrete set of things, rather than as exchangeable for the infinite set of all commodities-- the set of anything that can be valued as exchangeable.
In this way, money is an idea that is complementary and necessary to the commodity's coherence as a concept.
Without money, the commodity would not be a commodity at all.
#footnote[The complementarity of the commodity and money concepts is why, despite Althusser's infamous objection to the decision, Marx opens #emph[Capital] with the notoriously difficult chapters on the commodity (chapter 1), exchange (chapter 2), and money (chapter 3).
The circuit of exchange and its dual polarities ($C$ and $M$) are the logical kernel of capital, which is to say that they #emph[are] the bases of how capital appears to us in thought.]

We can specify the complementarity of the commodity and money as concepts by showing how the latter logically emerges from the former.
The commodity $C$ consists, as argued above, in the quality of its universal exchangeability.
A given commodity $A$ is conceptually exchangeable for any other commodity $B$ in the set of all commodities.
#footnote[This notation of two commodities as $A$ and $B$ follows Marx's original (German) notation.
Other notational decisions in this section also follow Marx where not otherwise specified.]
The commodity $A$ here should be recognized as abstract in the same sense as $B$, in that it is not just one particular commodity that is exchangeable, but #emph[any] commodity sampled from the set of all commodities.
More generally put, any commodity $A$ is exchangeable for any other commodity $B$:

#figure(
  [$A arrow.r B$],
  caption: [Commodity exchangeability (basic form)],
) <commodity:basic>

In order for this exchange to make logical sense, we can recognize that there must be something 'in' $A$ that is also 'in' $B$.
Marx calls this shared quality of commodities $A$ and $B$ #emph[exchange-value].
Exchange-value is not some tangible or physical quality that consists in both of the things that $A$ and $B$ index, but rather a quality that emerges #emph[by virtue of $A$ and $B$ becoming thought as commodities].
Exchange-value is a quality given by thought, by the thinkability of two things as exchangeable, rather than something that exists in the thing itself.

Recall that, as Marx is working from the axioms of political economy, we assume that all exchanges of commodities are 'fair'.
The exchange is made fair by equalizing the exchange-value of $A$ and $B$.
This equalization precipitates the appearance of a #emph[quantity] that works in tandem with exchange-value as a quality.
Marx's famous explanatory example here is that 20 yards of linen might be exchanged for 1 coat @marxCapitalCritiquePolitical2024[p.39].
The exponents '20' and '1' operate as the equalizing quantities, commensurating the exchange-value quality that is thought to exist in both linen and the coat.
We can call the quantities required to equalize the exchange-value of $A$ and $B$ for the sake of apparent fairness $x$ and $y$ respectively, expanding the basic form of commodity equation into the following simple-relative {#emph[einfache relative];} form:

#figure(
  [$x A arrow.r y B$],
  caption: [Commodity exchangeability (simple-relative form)],
) <commodity:simplerelative>


The quantites $x$ and $y$ liquidate the commodities $A$ and $B$ as fairly exchangeable in thought by the equalization of their exchange-value.
But how exactly are $A$ and $B$ made exchangeable in practice?
The answer, as Marx notes in chapter 3, is through their measurement in a singularly consistent 'third' commodity, which we already know to be $M$: money.
Money is the operative concept through which commodities become #emph[practically] exchangeable, the material anchor of their conceptual equalization.
We might say that money gives weight to the concept of the commodity as a universally exchangeable thing; which is to say that money gives weight to the concept of the commodity as such.

Marx begins #emph[Capital] with an elaboration of the commodity's wily concept because it is the elementary unit of capital's edifice as a set of inherently dependent ideas, the axiomatic 'brick' of its logical architecture.
The commodity necessitates a notion of money; as to act on its notion there needs to exist an exceptional commodity that guarantees the consistency of the commodity's universal exchangeability.
Money sutures the open wound of the commodity's impossible universality, providing a tangible way to act on the unthinkable infinity of #emph[all] possible commodity exchanges.

The two terms $M$ and $C$ are thus the denotative basis for Marx's logical unfolding of capital's consequences in the remainder of #emph[Capital], which is to say that they are the unit vectors of the geometry of capital as a totality {#emph[Totalität]}.
#footnote[As Lukacs notes, it is part and parcel of Marx's dialectical method to begin from the atomistic, apparently simple slices of society's conceptualization: #quote[Only in this context which sees the isolated facts of social life as aspects of the historical process and integrates them in a totality, can knowledge of the facts hope to become knowledge of reality. This knowledge starts from the simple (and to the capitalist world), pure, immediate, natural determinants described above. It progresses from them to the knowledge of the concrete totality, i.e. to the conceptual reproduction of reality. This concrete totality is by no means an unmediated datum for thought.] @lukacsHistoryClassConsciousness1972[p.8]]
The apparently pure and immediate categories $C$ and $M$ are not 'natural', as the economists would have it.
They are not self-sufficient and given, but rather logically depend on each other like the axes in a Cartesian coordinate system.
This is no flippant mathematical reference.
The commodity and money are the axiomatic bases of capital as a logical system as it is constructed on the premise of fair exchange.

Marx's critique of capital as a system of free and fair relations between people shares something critical with the mathematical method of proof by contradiction, in that it shows that the commodity's elementary pretext of fair exchange cannot logically amount, when expanded, to a system in which all become systematically better off.
#footnote[Jensen Suther has recently given an exceptionally clear explanation ofhow immanent critique tackles of systematic logic on its own terms over and beyond being simply internal criticism through the example of the United States Supreme Court:
  #quote[An immanent critique of an institution identifies the normative criteria of it #emph[as] that institution.
  To understand the idea of a 'constitutive norm', think of the rules of chess. To play a game is of chess is to subscribe to the rules that govern the game-- pawns move one space ahead except on the first move, bishops move unlimited spaces on the diagonal, and so on.
  To fail to abide by the rules-- to move one's pawn three spaces, say-- is not to play chess differently but to no longer be playing #emph[chess] at all.
  Now, an immanent critique targets such constitutive norms and proceeds in two steps.
First, it pursues a form of #emph[internal criticism]: the United States Supreme Court is tasked with adjudicating high-stakes legal disputes with decisive implications for how constitutional principles are to be understood and applied.
  In recent years, the court has issued a number of controversial decisions-- like #emph[Citizens United] and the reversal of #emph[Chevron];-- that have
arguably reflected a conservative form of 'judicial activism' that has greatly benefitted corporations.
  Yet this is at odds with the Court's avowed mission of impartially dispensing justice.
  Internal criticism has #emph[reform] as its consequence; in this case, term limits might be instituted as well as a set of ethical guidelines to which the justices must adhere.
  Second, internal criticism becomes immanent critique when the principles of the institution are themselves shown to entail their own corruption or contravention-- when, that is, internal criticism fails.
  The Supreme Court must ultimately uphold and reinforce the right to property underpinning American democracy.
  Yet this innately favors and shores up the propertied class, contradicting its own internal norm of impartial justice.
  This suggest that the present idea of the Court cannot be realized simply by bringing existing practices into accord with its internal principles; rather, the very conception of justice as the preservation of the right to property must be 'negated' to be realized #emph[as] justice.] @sutherTrueMaterialismHegelian2025[pp.10-11]]
As a mathematical method, proof by contradiction starts with an already-proven statement $S$.
One then proceeds to draw consequences from the contrary statement, not $S$ ($-S$), and works to reveal that at some point in the logical unfolding, a contradiction of an already-proven statement occurs.
When such a violation of a known fact appears, it can be safely assumed that the statement $-S$ is untenable, and therefore the opposite $S$ must be true.

Marx's immanent critique of the capital relation as a structure works by way of a similar principle.
If capital is logically consistent as a system, then its founding principle in the commodity as a universally exchangeable element should not violate the idea that the kinds of exchange that logically unfolds from it remains free and fair.
What Marx's analysis seeks to show is that capital is not, as the economic consensus claims, a mode of production uniquely suited to universal freedom and prosperity.
It is conversely a set of logically inconsistent conjectures that cannot stand up to the scrutiny of thorough rational examination.
#footnote[In a private letter, Marx made the imperious claim that the first volume of #emph[Capital] #quote[is without question the most terrible missile {#emph[furchtbarste Missile]} that has yet been hurled at the heads of the bourgeoisie] @marxMarxEngelsCorrespondence18671867.
  When we understand #emph[Capital] as a repudiation of the classical economic conception of society in its own terms, as a revelation of the contradiction at the heart of its logic, this claim does perhaps not seem so far off its mark.]
We will see later in this chapter how Marx's observance of contradictory nature of capital's concepts bears a reference to Russell's paradox and the emergence of set theory, not yet historically realized in Marx's own time given his death in 1883.
Indeed, it is the status of contradiction as a mathematical consistency in Marx's critical method that will allow us to see #emph[Capital] as the groundwork {#emph[Grundrisse]} for the sketch of the sexuated subject in the famous Lacanian formulas later in this chapter, and which will subsequently serve as the foundation for my case that Marxian critique remains material in our computationally inflected present.

Just as the commodity cannot be separated from money, supply cannot be separated from demand; production cannot be separated from circulation; and the capitalist cannot be separated from the proletariat (as we will see in the next section).
Each term can only ever be reasonably defined as the opposite of its other, as one pole of a concept in motion towards its opposite.
#footnote[This argument is made in David Harvey's introduction to #emph[Capital] @harveyCompanionMarxsCapital2018 as well as a more recent article in the New Left Review titled #emph[Value in Motion] @harveyValueMotion2020.]
Capital's totality is an economy of terms that, while in the realm of appearances {#emph[Erscheinung]} can seem self-sufficient and independent, in actuality {#emph[Sittlichkeit]} produces meaning only in the terms' relations to each other.
Capital's forms of appearance are not pure concepts that can be taken at face value, but are #quote[phenomena that conceal the inner working of [capital accumulation's] mechanism] @marxCapitalCritiquePolitical2024[p.520].
This split between appearance and reality is revealed, as we have seen, through the contradiction in capital's logical forms.
Capital-logic's claim that it is consistent is shown to be false, for there are immanent inconsistencies, internal flaws that cannot be ironed out through reform within the system, in its working.
Consequences emerge from these inconsistencies that are logically unaccountable in capital's conscious thought, its appearance.

We will call the realm of unaccountable consequences that necessarily emerges as the shadowy underside of capital-logic #strong[the unconscious].
As with the mathematical terminology above, this psychoanalytic lexicon is not spurious.
Psychoanalysis and the critique of political economy share in the recognition that reality cannot, logically speaking, consist simply of what appears to be the case.
The methods share a mutual and material mistrust in the consistency of thought.
#footnote[The philosopher Paul Ricouer thus nominates Marx and Freud as two, along with Nietzsche, 'masters of suspicion' in the canon of modern philosophy.]
Leopoldina Fortunati, one of Marx's most astute feminist readers in the late nineteenth century, refers to the unconscious that capital indexes as the sphere of #emph[reproduction] to evocatively counterpoint value's home stomping-grounds in the sphere of production @fortunatiLarcanoRiproduzioneCasalinghe1981.
#footnote[For the best English translation of Fortunati's book, refer to @fortunatiArcanaReproductionHousewives2025.]
Reproduction is the domain of activities that are not consciously counted in capital's calculus and as such cannot appear to matter (have value) in the context of its logic, such as the unpaid and thus 'unproductive' feminine labor that constitutes housework (cleaning, cooking, caring) and the biologically reproductive labor of carrying a child and giving birth.
That capital renders these kinds of labor unproductive with respect to its objective measure of value in money is striking evidence that something duplicitous lurks beneath the express idea that individuals are paid fairly according to their societal worth. Feminine reproductive labor is surely worth a significant #emph[something] when it comes to organizing a society in which human life is flourishing, one would have thought!
Yet capital-logic cannot account for it according to its conscious conception of value.

Marx's argument in #emph[Capital] is thus that capital is a #emph[synthetic] totality, not an actual one.
Though it is self-consciously totalizing-- that is, it appears to itself to be fully accountable-- in reality it represses a range of moments that are actually the unconscious foundation of its character.
One such repressed moment, indeed the foundational repression of capital in its pretense as a viable social relation, is the necessary codependence of $M$ and $C$ in the structure of its reasoning about value.
#footnote[In Volume III in particular, Marx details at length the grave consequences of treating $M$ as an independent entity that autonomously valorizes itself to $M'$, rather than recognizing that $'$ as a surplus-value that is always produced through its movement through $C$ as an intermediary value, as a dependent rather than independent variable.
  See @bestAutomaticFetishLaw2024 for an excellent exposition of these consequences.]
