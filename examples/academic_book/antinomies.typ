= Antinomies of Perpetual Peace
== The Republic of Morality
The wars of revolutionary France provoked in Germany the most famous philosophical response to them, namely the Kantian theory of peace#footnote[At this point I omit the complex relation between Kant’s philosophy and the French Revolution (also tied to the question of war and peace); on this see, e.g.: R. Comay, #emph[Mourning Sickness];, op. cit., pp. 26--55; S. Kouvelakis, #emph[Philosophy and Revolution. From Kant to Marx];, trans. G.M. Goshgarian, introduction F. Jameson, London & New York: Verso, 2003, pp. 9--27; D. Losurdo, #emph[Immanuel Kant. Freiheit, Recht und Revolution];, trans. E. Brielmayer, Köln: Pahl--Rugenstein, 1987.];.
Although an outline of this theory can be found in Kant’s first treatise in the philosophy of history, entitled #emph[Idea powszechnej historii w aspekcie kosmopolitycznym] (#emph[Idee zur einer allgemeinen Geschichte in] #emph[weltbürgerlicher Absicht];)#footnote[This text was published in two Polish translations (under two different titles); in the present work I use the second edition; see #emph[RFH];.] from 1784, it is expressed in full form in works that directly react to the war of 1792‒1795. Above all, two texts are at issue: #emph[O porzekadle: To może być słuszne w teorii, ale nic nie jest warte w praktyce] (#emph[Über den Gemeinspruch: Das mag in der Theorie richtig sein, taugt aber nicht für die Praxis];) (1793) and, of course, #emph[Do wiecznego pokoju] (#emph[Zum ewigen Frieden];) (1795). Proper understanding of the project of “perpetual peace”#footnote[Kant did not invent the very idea of “perpetual peace.” Its initiator can be considered Father Charles-Irénée Castel de Saint-Pierre (1658--1743), who, after the peace congress in Utrecht (1713), developed a conception according to which the countries of Christian Europe could conclude among themselves a peace that would last forever. He set out his ideas in the philosophical-legal treatise #emph[Projet pour rendre la paix perpétuelle en Europe];. This work met with a strong response among Europe’s educated strata, provoking numerous polemics, including the most famous by Leibniz, Voltaire, and King Frederick II (whom Saint-Pierre attacked for the war in Austria). Saint-Pierre’s idea of perpetual peace was taken up—this time more affirmatively—by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in the treatise #emph[Jugement du Projet de paix perpétuelle de Monsieur l'Abbé de Saint-Pierre];, in which he considered the possibility of establishing a European League. Ultimately, he deemed this idea “good in theory but worth nothing in practice,” since establishing such a federation would necessarily require the use of illicit means of coercion. As the editors of his #emph[Rozpraw z filozofii historii]; report, Kant became acquainted with Father Saint-Pierre’s project as early as around 1755/1756 and was skeptical of it—but, like Rousseau, not because of the idea itself, but because of the proposed implementation. See I. Kant, #emph[O porzekadle: To może być słuszne w teorii, ale nic nie jest warte w praktyce];, in: #emph[RFH];, p. 150, note 17.] requires placing it within the broader context of Kant’s political thought#footnote[As Marek Siemek notes: “The treatise on peace presupposes and expounds Kant’s entire practical philosophy—that is, ethics. The questions of war and peace—not only of war between states but also of civil war and social peace within each state (remember that the historical context here is the onset of an over quarter-century-long pan-European war, triggered by the two great revolutions of modernity: the American and, above all, the French)—are there directly linked to the question of universal principles according to which a rational construction of a politico-civic order is possible in the post-revolutionary, modern world. (…) it is precisely the problematic of war and peace that is the place where, as in a lens, the entire ethos of rational autonomy and communicative dialogue represented by the Kantian philosophy of freedom is focused.” (I rejected corrections, because that was the form of the sentence in Siemek). (M.J. Siemek, #emph[Wolność, prawo, sprawiedliwość. Filozofia praktyczna Kanta a polityczny etos nowoczesności];, in: idem, #emph[Wolność, rozum, intersubiektywność];, Warszawa: Oficyna Naukowa, 2002, p. 112)];, focused around two problems: #emph[history] and the relation of #emph[politics] and #emph[morality];.

History is part of nature—this is the fundamental thesis of Kant’s philosophy of history. This means that the subject of history is the human species as a natural kind which constantly moves—according to nature’s own laws—toward progress, that is, toward achieving the full development of the human being’s possibilities and features, the crowning of creation. History, therefore, is a process of perfecting the human as a species, the gradual realization of its original predispositions. In other words, “[in – B.W.] the distant future the human species will finally work out a state in which all the seeds that nature has placed in it can fully develop, and its vocation here on earth will be fulfilled”#footnote[I. Kant, #emph[Idea powszechnej historii w aspekcie kosmopolitycznym];, in: #emph[RFH];, p. 42.];. Yet the most important potential that nature has deposited in the human is its spontaneous freedom, which transcends “the mechanical order of animal existence”#footnote[Ibid., p. 33.];. Nature thus creates a human being whose most proper possibility of being itself is freedom understood as #emph[causa sui];, being one’s own cause—what is most natural in the human turns out to be its capacity to negate natural determination. Nature’s true goal, its highest progress, manifests itself in human freedom, which is at once the negation and full realization of nature. This paradox can be cast in the form of the Kantian #emph[antinomia historii];: we must think of progress in history #emph[noumenally];, as the activity of a free human, and at the same time we must think of it #emph[phenomenally];, as the necessary work of nature itself#footnote[See the Third Antinomy of Pure Reason concerning the concept of causality (necessary and free), I. Kant, #emph[Krytyka czystego rozumu];, op. cit., pp. 185--195.];.

The intelligible freedom of the human and the necessary order of nature remain inseparably conjoined. A clear-cut answer is therefore undecidable as to whether history is guided by the manifest deeds of humans or the hidden ruse of nature#footnote[See T. Kupś, #emph[Historiozofia Immanuela Kanta jako moralna teleologia];, in: #emph[RFH];, p. 19.];. Most forcefully this logic and its built-in ambiguity are expressed in the famous concept of “unsocial sociability”—the unavoidable antagonism of individuals as the means selected by nature itself for the realization of humankind’s general species-ends (that is, ultimately, liberation from that very nature, gained in the world of culture as a “second nature”). As Kant argues:

#quote(block: true)[
#emph[The means that nature uses so that all predispositions] [of humanity – B.W.] #emph[may develop is antagonism in society insofar as it ultimately becomes the source of a law-giving order];. By antagonism I understand here #emph[the unsocial sociability of human beings] (#emph[die ungesellige Geselligkeitt der Menschen];), i.e., their inclination to live in society, which, however, is combined with an all‑too‑general resistance that constantly threatens to break up society. (…) At this point the first true step occurs from barbarism to culture, which in essence consists in the cultivation of the social values of the human#footnote[I. Kant, #emph[Idea powszechnej historii];, op. cit., p. 43. This dialectical idea of the progressive role of antagonism, used by nature to deepen the process of socialization, already appeared in the British Enlightenment: in Bernard Mandeville’s #emph[Bajka o pszczołach] published in various editions in 1714--1729 (idem, #emph[Bajka o pszczołach];, trans. A. Glinczanka, W. Chwalewik, Warszawa: PWN, 1957), and it was more systematically developed by Adam Ferguson in the 1776 #emph[Rozważaniach o historii społeczeństwa obywatelskiego] (idem, #emph[An Essay on the History of Civil Society];, London: T. Cadell, 1782). Siemek notes that the entire German culture at the turn of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries remained within the influence of the English rather than the French Enlightenment, a tradition that emphasized the universal physico-spiritual harmony, the unity of nature and human beings founded on the metaphysical order of a perfect world (which was questioned in the skeptical-materialist French Enlightenment); see, e.g., M.J. Siemek, #emph[Wolność i utopia w myśli filozoficznej Schillera];, Warszawa: Wydawnictwo UW, 2017, pp. 50--53.];.
]

Kant proposes to resolve the metaphysical antinomy of freedom and nature, which in the social plane finds its expression in the split between politics and morality, through the idea of the Enlightenment state of reason as a kingdom of ends (#emph[Reich der Zwecke];)#footnote[That is, a state whose citizens all fulfill the categorical imperative; see I. Kant, #emph[Uzasadnienie metafizyki moralności];, trans. M. Wartenberg, Kęty: Wydawnictwo Marek Derewiecki, 2009, p. 55. Siemek calls it “a thoroughly intersubjective community of ethical subjects,” in which the principle of autonomy of the will (the most important idea of Kantian ethics) can be realized. See M.J. Siemek, #emph[Etyka i polityka w świetle filozofii transcendentalnej];, in: idem, #emph[Fichte w kontekście];, introduction: J. Kloc-Konkołowicz, Warszawa: Wydawnictwo UW, 2017, p. 227.];.
The problem of the very grounding of politics in morality and the mutual interaction of the two spheres is one of the key issues for contemporary scholars of the Königsberg philosopher’s social philosophy#footnote[See, e.g.: M.J. Siemek, #emph[Wolność, prawo, sprawiedliwość];, op. cit.; J. Habermas, #emph[Strukturalne przeobrażenia sfery publicznej];, op. cit., pp. 215--241; S. Kouvelakis, #emph[Philosophy and Revolution];, op. cit., pp. 16--19.];. It is generally claimed that the theory of peace provides evidence for the unity between “pure” practical reason—#emph[morality]—and its “application” in history and society—#emph[politics];. There is a strict relation between the a priori legislation of practical reason and the realization of those laws in the sphere of politics, in the form of the ideas of #emph[just law] and #emph[justice];#footnote[See M.J. Siemek, #emph[Wolność, prawo, sprawiedliwość];, op. cit., pp. 109--110.];. Morality without politics is powerless, while politics without morality is blind. Pure practical reason poses two questions: the #emph[moral] one—“what is lawful; what ought we to do?” and the #emph[political] one—“how to secure the law’s binding force; how to realize what ought to be?”. In the “Appendix” to #emph[Do wiecznego pokoju] we read:

#quote(block: true)[
In true politics, therefore, not a single step can be taken before paying homage to morality, and although politics in itself is a difficult art, reconciling it with morality is no art at all, for morality cuts the knot that politics cannot untie, insofar as the two remain in mutual contradiction. Human right must be recognized as sacred, even if this recognition costs the ruling power very great sacrifices#footnote[I. Kant, #emph[Do wiecznego pokoju];, in: #emph[RFH] p. 198.];.
]

We see how the three elementary concepts of Kant’s practical philosophy—morality, law, and politics—mediate one another. Ethics, whose paramount category is the universal validity of just law, in this context constitutes the rational form of politics. Reducing politics to morality does not at all mean turning away from action in the real world.

#quote(block: true)[
It is, however, clear—notes Étienne Balibar—that politics in Kant’s notion lies neither on the side of morality and duty, nor on the side of law and its effectiveness, but precisely in the linkage, the practical “synthesis” of these two independent elements. It consists in governing people in such a way that they act according to these two criteria#footnote[E. Balibar, #emph[Trwoga mas. Polityka i filozofia przed Marksem i po Marksie];, trans. A. Staroń, Warszawa: Wydawnictwo Akademickie “Dialog”, 2007, p. 102.];.
]

The political community of free citizens turns out to be the medium of mediation between politics and morality. Kant posits two demands for such a community: the system of every civil state should be republican (but not democratic-egalitarian), and relations between states should be regulated within a cosmopolitan federation guaranteeing perpetual peace. The #emph[internal] civic freedom and the #emph[external] cosmopolitan peace overlap as transcendental conditions of a perfectly just order in which “reason alone ought to rule”#footnote[I. Kant, #emph[Krytyka władzy sądzenia];, trans. J. Gałecki, Warszawa: PWN, 2004, p. 428.];. According to Habermas, the basis of such an order—the enlightened and at the same time enlightening state—is “publicity,” constitutive of the “public sphere” (#emph[Öffentlichkeit];)#footnote[See J. Habermas, #emph[Strukturalne przeobrażenia sfery publicznej];, op. cit., pp. 218--219.];. In the state that is the synthesis of the civil constitution and perpetual peace, “all political actions must, in the public dimension, be derivable from that which constitutes the basis of norms, which, in turn, have been demonstrated before public opinion to be universal and rational norms”#footnote[Ibid., p. 227.];. Politics is then transformed into morality. #emph[Politics becomes morality] (“lawful in general”), and #emph[morality gains political efficacy] (“the rule of the norm”) only within the framework of the cosmopolitan republic, which realizes universal law and perpetual peace#footnote[See I. Kant, #emph[Do wiecznego pokoju];, op. cit., p. 203.];. In other words, this project can be described as a cosmopolitan public sphere in which citizens make “public use of their own reason”#footnote[I. Kant, #emph[Odpowiedź na pytanie: czym jest oświecenie?];, in: #emph[RFH] pp. 45--46.];.

The Kantian Enlightenment republic is a liberal state under the rule of law that comes into being “in bourgeois homes”#footnote[See J. Habermas, #emph[Strukturalne przeobrażenia sfery publicznej];, op. cit., p. 223.];. It is born out of the world of literary salons and discussion clubs where educated citizens discourse on the politics and culture of their surrounding world. This circulation of thought is conditioned by the economic infrastructure of the public sphere, which rests on the free competition of consumers and owners. The autonomy of the Kantian citizen, the participant in the public, “puts down roots in the sphere of commodity exchange”#footnote[Ibid., p. 229.];. The circulation of ideas among users of reason finds its “earthly basis” in free market competition. Therefore, for Kant, being a citizen means fulfilling one condition (excluding the fact that children and women were excluded from this concept):

#quote(block: true)[
namely, that he be #emph[master of himself] (#emph[sui iuris];), and, in connection with this, that he possess some property (one can also include here any art, craft, the fine arts, or the sciences) from which he is able to support himself (…); and thus that he serve no one other than the community in the proper sense of the word #emph[service];#footnote[I. Kant, #emph[O porzekadle];, op. cit., pp. 134--135.];.
]

Accordingly, the wage worker—whose only commodity for exchange is labor power and not owned goods—and the plebeian, who has #emph[nothing] to exchange, are excluded from the civic public sphere. The kingdom of ends thus turns out to be a petty-bourgeois#footnote[Petty-bourgeois,” because every, even the smallest and most primitive, producer or owner of commodities has his citizenship guaranteed in it as a participant in free competition.] merchants’ republic, and the condition of the resonating #emph[citoyen] turns out to be the working #emph[bourgeois];. The modern prosaic #emph[Bürger] dresses up in the garb of the virtuous ancient #emph[polites];. In short, the citizen of the public is an abstraction of the burgher; he produces opinions instead of commodities. Kant thus becomes the leading ideologue#footnote[Hegel already recognized the ideological function of the public sphere in Kant; see J. Habermas, #emph[Strukturalne przeobrażenia sfery publicznej];, op. cit., pp. 242--250.] and the philosophical “founding father” of the #emph[liberal] model of the bourgeois public sphere, which is founded on the suppression of #emph[plebeian] variants of publicity#footnote[Habermas attributes this suppression to the dialectic of historical progress in which the leading role was played by the bourgeoisie and its institutions, not by the plebeian masses. However, his omission of plebeian and popular publics met with broad criticism from scholars who accuse him of historical unreliability and simplifications characteristic of liberal ideology (see, e.g., A. Kluge, O. Negt, #emph[Public Sphere and Experience. Analysis of the Bourgeois and Proletarian Public Sphere];, trans. P. Labanyi et al., London & New York: Verso, 2016; F. Jameson, #emph[On Negt and Kluge];, October 46/ 1988 (autumn), pp. 151--177; E. Majewska, #emph[Kontrpubliczności ludowe i feministyczne];, Warszawa: Instytut Wydawniczy Książki i Prasy, 2018, pp. 115--142.)];. The consequence for the philosophy of the state is as follows: the empirical people (embracing citizens and non-citizens, burghers and plebeians) constitute at once a #emph[premise] for the emergence of the state and an #emph[obstacle] to its formation#footnote[See E. Balibar, #emph[Trwoga mas];, op. cit., p. 91.];. Within the state of reason—the synthesis of politics and morality—this people must be transformed from above, through Enlightenment reforms, so that each becomes a citizen guided by the categorical imperative. Thanks to this, the empirical people are turned into the noumenal people—civil society (#emph[b];#emph[ürgerliche Gesellschaft];)#footnote[Strictly speaking, the more adequate translation would be #emph[społeczeństwo mieszczańskie];, because the German #emph[Bürger] represents a typically #emph[banausic] stance characteristic of merchants and craftsmen striving to satisfy their private interests, which is opposed to the #emph[thymotic] mentality of the ancient soldier‑citizen who sacrifices himself for the generality (on the philosophical genealogy of the liberal bourgeois society see N. Gładziuk, #emph[Polityka jako współżycie z wrogiem: rodowody koncepcji liberalnej];, in: #emph[Koncepcje polityki];, ed. W. Wesołowski, Warszawa: Wydawnictwo Naukowe Scholar 2009, pp. 29--64).];. In this process the universal state plays the role of the supreme Enlightenment educator; it is the collective incarnation of the Kantian intellectual#footnote[See S. Kouvelakis, #emph[Philosophy and Revolution];, op. cit., p. 13.];, who teaches people their own rights, presents them with the rules of their collective freedom, that is, the freedom of the autonomous individual limited only by the freedom of others. The state thus ultimately provides the framework for the social reproduction of the liberal system of the mutually competing #emph[citoyen-bourgeois] in the market of commodities and opinions. Only within this ideological horizon can we consider the project of perpetual peace, born of the spirit of commerce#footnote[See I. Kant, #emph[Do wiecznego pokoju];, op. cit., p. 187.];.

== The Peace of Enlightenment
<peace-of-enlightenment>
The problematic of war and peace, taken in the moral-political sense, appears for the first time in the already mentioned treatise #emph[Idea powszechnej historii w aspekcie kosmopolitycznym];, written by Kant in Königsberg in 1784, at the end of the reign of the “soldier-king” Frederick II the Great, who transformed his state into a barracked military power. Frederick’s Prussia built its international position thanks to victorious wars, while remaining civilizationally, economically, and socially a backward country, mired in feudal relations. It is truly difficult to imagine a more adequate place on the map of Europe at that time for philosophically reflecting on the essence and character of war, especially as the philosopher still remembered well the devastation brought by one of the bloodiest and most senseless wars of modern Europe, the Seven Years’ War, which, incidentally, elevated Prussia to the rank of a world power.

In thesis seven of his text, Kant observes that the establishment of a perfect civil constitution (the republic of reason) requires the regulation of “external relations between states”#footnote[I. Kant, #emph[Idea powszechnej historii];, op. cit., p. 37. Balibar rightly notes that “the close connection between two forms of ‘commerce’ (the circulation of goods #emph[and] the circulation of ideas, hence the free circulation of people as commodities #emph[and] as intellectuals) constituted the natural (but insufficient) condition of universal peace” (E. Balibar, #emph[Trwoga mas];, op. cit., p. 122, note 70).];. Nature, acting as the force that drives history, uses antagonism between people and entire societies so that, through a state of wars and conflicts, it ultimately leads to peace. The road to a league of nations, a cosmopolitan federation, runs through barbarism playing out on the stage of history. He notes:

#quote(block: true)[
Thus all wars (to be sure, not in the intentions of human beings, but in the intentions of nature) are attempts to introduce new relations between states by destroying, or at least partitioning, old political organisms and creating new ones, which in turn, whether for internal or external reasons, will also be unable to sustain themselves and therefore must undergo revolutions#footnote[I. Kant, #emph[Idea powszechnej historii];, op. cit., p. 38.];.
]

Only the establishment of a federal civil constitution can break this destructive spiral of progress. Here Kant points to the teleological structure of history, which makes use of wars up to now in order to bring about the end of all wars—that is, the point at which war becomes impossible. Why is such a state necessary from the point of view of his conception of history? Because waging wars does not allow the realization of the human species’ natural predispositions, since it hampers the free existence of particular nations, which are always exposed to the risk of destruction in the turmoil of war.

#quote(block: true)[
In other words: although, because all the forces of one community are consumed by armaments against another, because of the devastation caused by wars, and, above all, because of the necessity of remaining constantly prepared for them, the full development of predispositions is hampered. At the same time, the resulting sufferings compel our species to find, for the mutual opposition of states against one another, which in itself is salutary and which arises from their freedom, laws of balance and a united authority. This, in turn, will become its certification (#emph[Nachdruck];), and thus it will introduce the cosmopolitan state of universal security for all states (…)#footnote[Ibid., p. 39.];.
]

The critique of war proceeds here along two tracks. From the #emph[transcendental] perspective, war is a disturbance of the teleological development of the human species, since it prevents the constitution of the republican system in each state, which provides the politico-legal frame for the rational and moral life of the individual. The condition of possibility of Kant’s moral civil order is therefore perpetual peace. From the #emph[phenomenal] perspective, war entails destructive consequences in the everyday existence of nations, causing devastation and mass suffering and, as such, embodies anti-civilizational barbarism. It is also economically disadvantageous for the state, as it consumes resources that should be invested in the educational project of public Enlightenment (as we read in thesis eight of the treatise):

#quote(block: true)[
And thus, although, for example, the rulers of our world have no money for universal educational institutions and, in general, for everything that concerns the good of the world, because all resources have already been earmarked in advance for future wars (…). Finally, war itself is slowly becoming not only an undertaking complicated and uncertain in its outcome for both sides, but also very risky because of its effect, namely, the growing war debts (this new invention) whose repayment is not envisaged#footnote[Ibid., p. 41.];.
]

And, as he adds in the treatise #emph[O porzekadle: To może być słuszne w teorii, ale nic nie jest warte w praktyce] (from 1793, i.e., already after the outbreak of the revolutionary war), the increasing number of wars leads to greater costs#footnote[“The desire to subjugate another or rob him of what is his has always existed, and one can never diminish the armaments necessary for defense, which often make peace even heavier and more destructive for internal prosperity than war itself. Against this there is no other remedy besides international law based on public and force-backed rights, to which every state should subordinate itself” (I. Kant, #emph[O porzekadle];, op. cit., p. 150).]—related to larger armies and expensive military technologies: “No peace lasts long enough for the savings made during it to equal the expenditures on the next war, and the invention of the national debt is indeed an ingenious, but in the final reckoning self‑destructive, means”#footnote[Ibid., p. 149.];.

Abstracting from Kant’s naive historiosophical optimism—heralding, less than ten years before the outbreak of Europe’s “twenty‑year war,” the proximity of a “universal cosmopolitan state”—his critique of the technical-practical aspect of war (high costs, incurred debts, uncertain investment of capital, and so on) anticipates the typical liberal critique of armament and military policy. For the modern #emph[bourgeois], the risk of destroying the sacred foundation of property that wars bring threatens only his interests. The capitalist commercial society, in the mouths of its early ideologues, will in theory be distrustful of wars#footnote[Kant’s thinking here was certainly significantly influenced by Montesquieu with his conception of the liberal political community; see N. Gładziuk, #emph[Polityka jako współżycie z wrogiem];, op. cit., pp. 32--50. In the context of the current war of Russia against Ukraine, this thesis again shows its relevance: the elites of those European countries that have the most common economic interests with the Russian Federation (Germany, Italy, or Austria) advocate the fastest possible end to the conflict and a return to #emph[business as usual];.];, although social practice will show rather that wars can be quite profitable, especially when the idea of a common global market remains a projection of the future. It is interesting that, on the occasion of the economic dimension of war, Kant points to the mechanism of the national debt which, for liberal supporters of #emph[laissez faire]—to this day—represents the most oppressive face of the state behemoth, thus “robbing” its citizens.

In 1795, when France signed the Peace of Basel with Prussia, Kant published his most important treatise in political philosophy, namely #emph[Do wiecznego pokoju];#footnote[The title of the treatise and its first sentence (“Whether that satirical inscription on a Dutch innkeeper’s signboard, on which a graveyard was painted, refers to #emph[men] in general, or particularly to the never‑sated of wars rulers of states, or only to philosophers dreaming that sweet dream—may remain undecided,” I. Kant, #emph[Do wiecznego pokoju];, op. cit., p. 164) refers to Leibniz’s remarks against Saint-Pierre: “I recall an inscription over a cemetery gate which read: #emph[perpetual peace];. For the dead do not fight each other, but the living are of another mind, and the mightiest among them attach no weight to the verdict of the court” (Leibniz, #emph[Codex Juris Genetium Diplomaticus];, Hanover 1693, cited in: #emph[RFH];, p. 164; note 1.)];. This coincidence is certainly no accident, for the text formally imitates contemporary peace treaties; it is divided into: “preliminary articles” (#emph[Pr];#emph[äliminarartikel];), “definitive articles” (#emph[Definitivartikel];), and “secret articles” (#emph[Geheimartikel];). The first of these, six in number, define the preliminary conditions for establishing universal peace—some of them are #emph[stricte] formal-legal in character (for example, the first, distinguishing a truce from peace#footnote[See I. Kant, #emph[Do wiecznego pokoju];, op. cit., p. 165.];), while others are politico-moral (for example, the third—the postulate of abolishing the standing army, which constitutes a constant potential for the outbreak of war#footnote[Ibid., p. 166.]—or the sixth, prohibiting immoral methods of waging war#footnote[Ibid., p. 168.];). The preliminary articles project solutions that should be introduced within existing relations between states as a basis for the full realization of the pacifist idea. Achieving #emph[perpetual peace] requires changing the very form of conducting wars and concluding agreements. Hence Kant writes: “A certain degree of trust in the enemy’s way of thinking must be preserved even in the midst of hostilities, for otherwise no peace could be concluded, and hostilities would turn into a war of extermination”#footnote[Ibid.];. Without mutual trust between states at war—understood as the capacity to keep an agreement—the very prospect of peace cannot be conceived.

The three #emph[Definitive Articles] delineate the necessary conditions for perpetual peace (in the three domains of the validity of law—domestic, international, and cosmopolitan). If war is the wild #emph[state of nature] for the human being, then peace is a moral #emph[task to be established];#footnote[See ibid., p. 170.] for the civil constitution:

+ #emph[In the relation of the citizen to the state] this will be the republican order, which for Kant is the transcendental basis of every empirical state#footnote[In the #emph[Sporze fakultetów] Kant develops this conception: “The idea—says the philosophical faculty in its dispute with the law faculty—of a constitution in accordance with the natural rights of human beings, according to which those who belong to the law‑abiding should be united, and should themselves be legislators, lies at the basis of the very forms of states; and the community which, according to this idea, is conceived by means of pure concepts of reason is called the Platonic #emph[ideal] (#emph[res publica noumenon];) and is not an empty fiction but an eternal norm preventing all wars for every civil constitution” (I. Kant, #emph[Spór fakultetów];. #emph[Wznowione pytanie czy rodzaj ludzki stale zmierza ku temu, co lepsze?];, trans. and introduction: M. Żelazny, Lubicz: Wydawnictwo Rolewski, 2003, pp. 142--143). Only, for Kant the ideal has a meaning as far as possible from a Platonic constitutive idea of reality, since it can be assigned only a regulative function; it signifies “an idea #emph[in individuo];, i.e., a particular thing that can be determined only by an idea or is determined by it” (I. Kant, #emph[Krytyka czystego rozumu];, vol. 2, op. cit., p. 310; see also: J. Habermas, #emph[Strukturalne przeobrażenia sfery publicznej];, op. cit., pp. 236--238). In a word, the ideal is only a model, a guideline for our actions.];.
  Republicanism signifies a “mode of governance” (in accord with universal legislation, and thus guaranteeing peace#footnote[As we read in the so‑called #emph[Fragment królewiecki];: “war cannot be eliminated by anything other than true #emph[republicanism] of a powerful state—and without its avoidance progress is not possible. However, even war leads to republicanism and in the end must lead to it. When, then, will war vanish? When freedom and equality, which are the causes of there being no wars, endlessly generate a culture of ever better deeds, as well as progress” (I. Kant, #emph[Fragment królewiecki.

As we have already noted, the republic of reason is by no means a democracy, which, in the Aristotelian spirit, is identified with the despotism of the majority. Consequently, the form most conducive to the civic republic is the constitutional monarchy, within which the king is the representative of the nation as a whole (and not of its majority, as in democracy, or of its minority, as in the rule of aristocrats)#footnote[“One could therefore say: the smaller the personnel of state power (the number of persons exercising power) and the greater its representativeness, the more the state constitution corresponds to the possibilities of republicanism, and one may hope that through gradual reforms it will eventually rise to it. For this reason, in an aristocracy it is already harder than in a monarchy to achieve that single fully lawful constitution, whereas in a democracy this is not possible except through a revolution amounting to violence” (ibid., p. 171). Democracy, then, may be republican, but only at the price of revolution, which Kant rejects in favor of reform as a more rational and civilized way of practicing politics.];.

+ #emph[In relations between states] it will be a “league of nations”—a cosmopolitan federation which is not at all a world state but its opposite: “instead of the positive idea of a #emph[world republic];, only a #emph[negative] surrogate of an ever‑expanding #emph[league];, lasting and protecting against war, is able to hold back the stream of hostile and law‑evading inclinations, and even that with the constant danger that alliances may collapse”#footnote[Ibid., p. 178.];. Among interpreters, controversy is raised by the question of the powers that the “federal center” would have over other states. Could it coerce them into observing international law? How could it exert such coercion? Finally, would not such a center, focused on a single most enlightened nation (“happily constituted as a republic”#footnote[See ibid., p. 177.];), turn into the despotic world state from which it was supposed to protect? Kant leaves these problems without an unambiguous resolution#footnote[See M. Zahn, #emph[Kantowska teoria pokoju];, trans. M. Poręba, in: #emph[Filozofia transcendentalna a dialektyka];, ed. M. J. Siemek, Warszawa: Oficyna Naukowa, 1994, p. 14.];.

+ #emph[In the relation of the citizen to the cosmopolitan order];. Key to maintaining universal peace is the observance of the right to hospitality (#emph[Hospitalität];), that is, the universal right to migration. There is no area of the earth that would be the exclusive property of a given community, nation, or individual—therefore the newcomer may not be treated with hostility#footnote[See I. Kant, #emph[Do wiecznego pokoju];, op. cit., p. 178.];. The proper result of the utopia of perpetual peace would be such a global order in which exchange—commercial, cultural, and social alike—would take place without any obstacles, and the intensity of interpersonal ties would increase thanks to the development of locomotion, communication, and information flows. Kant thus anticipates the liberal idea of globalization—a world community in which “the violation of law in #emph[one] place is felt #emph[everywhere];”#footnote[Ibid., p. 181.];.

Besides the proper articles, the treatise contains two addenda—“On the Guarantee of Perpetual Peace” and a “secret article”—of which the first is particularly noteworthy, for it contains the philosophical justification of the entire project. There Kant develops his key idea of the philosophy of history (already presented in the #emph[Idei powszechniej historii…];) of nature as a naturalized providence#footnote[As Siemek notes, this substitution of nature for proper history is a heritage of the Enlightenment philosophy—“Kant’s ‘nature’ (‘przyroda’) is here a cryptonym of the very #emph[historicity] of human socialization” (M.J. Siemek, #emph[Filozofia wobec wyzwań społecznej modernizacji];, in: #emph[HF] p. 165).];, realizing in history its ultimate end—the “moralization” of the human. War is inscribed into this naturalist‑teleological narrative, the Kantian historiosophy, becoming responsible for driving people into the farthest corners of the earth and for establishing the original legal relations between them#footnote[See #emph[Do wiecznego pokoju];, op. cit., p. 183.];. However, in the modern era, in which the bourgeois spirit of commerce reigns and the feudal warrior has been replaced by the bourgeois upstart, war ought to be displaced by peace.

Just as nature, on the one hand, wisely separated nations, among which the will of each state—even one grounded in international law itself—would gladly like, by cunning or force, to subordinate other states, so, on the other hand, it unites, by the power of mutual, advantageous interest, those nations which the concept of cosmopolitan right would not protect from violence and war. This is the #emph[spirit of commerce];, which cannot coexist with war and will sooner or later take hold of every nation. Since, of all the powers (means) subordinate to state authority, the #emph[power of money] proves the most reliable, states feel compelled (naturally not by moral motives) to support an honest peace and, wherever war would threaten in the world, to prevent it through their mediation, as if they were in a lasting alliance for this purpose; for great alliances formed for war can, by their nature, very rarely be realized, and even more rarely be successful. In this way, through the very mechanism of human inclinations, nature guarantees perpetual peace (…)#footnote[Ibid., p. 187.];.

In the foregoing argument, Kant maintained that it is nature which, through the universal civil republic established by humans, carries the promise of perpetual peace. Yet in the passage above one can discern the hidden material condition of Kant’s project of peace: “the #emph[power of money] proves the most reliable.” Thus it is the #emph[rule of capitalist social relations];, the global market, that turns out to be the foundation of the #emph[rule of law and morality] in the cosmopolitan aspect. The very idea of cosmopolitanism is therefore a cryptonym of world capital—the more trade, the more international circulation of goods and money, the closer to universal peace. Kant again appears as a leading ideologue of the bourgeois-capitalist public sphere. It is not the finite human and the always limited deeds of the individual, nor even nature, the ruse steering history, but precisely money that possesses the real power to establish peace: “What I am not able to do as a #emph[human];, what all the forces of my individual being are not able to do, I am able to do with the help of #emph[money];”#footnote[K. Marx, #emph[Rękopisy ekonomiczno--filozoficzne z 1844 r.];, in: K. Marks, F. Engels, #emph[Dzieła];, vol. 1, op. cit., p. 612.];.
