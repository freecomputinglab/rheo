# Unified exclude patterns support both exclude and include-only modes:
# - Regular patterns (e.g., "*.tmp") exclude matching files
# - Negated patterns (e.g., "!**/*.typ") include ONLY matching files
#
# The pattern below includes ONLY .typ files and img/** files for HTML output:
exclude = ["!**/*.typ", "!img/**"]
#
# Old syntax (deprecated but still works):
# static_files = ["img/**"]
