Welcome!

CfTW is a book designed for those actively engaged in the operational edifice of 'big tech' who seek to reflect on the ethics and politics of working in that space.
To facilitate that reflection, we adopt a tried and tested method to which a century and a half of political struggle attests: reading and re-reading Karl Marx's monumental work #emph[Capital].

Marx's #emph[Capital] {#emph[Das Kapital]} was written in German in the mid-to-late nineteenth century (1850s-1880s).
#block[When we reference Marx's original German (or another author's original language) in this book, we use this curly bracket syntax to indicate {#emph[zeigen]} it.
If you don't read German or the original language, don't worry!
You can safely ignore anything in curly brackets: we just put them there as a reference for those who find the original terms helpful or explanatory.]
Marx originally had a multi-volume edition planned, but only one volume-- volume I-- was actually published in his lifetime in 1867.
Versions of volumes II and III of #emph[Capital] were not published until after Marx died by his friend and collaborator Freidrich Engels, and they were deduced from his working notes rather than written as more polished manuscript that Marx himself saw through to publication, as was the case with volume I.
