  abstract = {We introduce a machine learning workflow to search for, identify, and meaningfully triage videos and images of munitions, weapons, and military equipment, even when limited training data exists for the object of interest. This workflow is designed to expedite the work of OSINT ("open source intelligence") researchers in human rights investigations. It consists of three components: automatic rendering and annotating of synthetic datasets that make up for a lack of training data; training image classifiers from combined sets of photographic and synthetic data; and mtriage, an open source software that orchestrates these classifiers' deployment to triage public domain media, and visualise predictions in a web interface. We show that synthetic data helps to train classifiers more effectively, and that certain approaches yield better results for different architectures. We then demonstrate our workflow in two real-world human rights investigations: the use of the Triple-Chaser tear gas grenade against civilians, and the verification of allegations of military presence in Ukraine in 2014.},

  author = {Brown, Wendy},
  year = 2015,
  publisher = {Zone Books},
  address = {New York},
  abstract = {Tracing neoliberalism's devastating erosions of democratic principles, practices, and cultures. Neoliberal rationality---ubiquitous today in statecraft and the workplace, in jurisprudence, education, and culture---remakes everything and everyone in the image of homo oeconomicus. What happens when this rationality transposes the constituent elements of democracy into an economic register? In Undoing the Demos, Wendy Brown explains how democracy itself is imperiled. The demos disintegrates into bits of human capital; concerns with justice bow to the mandates of growth rates, credit ratings, and investment climates; liberty submits to the imperative of human capital appreciation; equality dissolves into market competition; and popular sovereignty grows incoherent. Liberal democratic practices may not survive these transformations. Radical democratic dreams may not either.In an original and compelling argument, Brown explains how and why neoliberal reason undoes the political form and political imaginary it falsely promises to secure and reinvigorate. Through meticulous analyses of neoliberalized law, political practices, governance, and education, she charts the new common sense. Undoing the Demos makes clear that for democracy to have a future, it must become an object of struggle and rethinking.},
