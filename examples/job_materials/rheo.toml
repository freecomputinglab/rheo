# rheo.toml - Configuration for rheo compilation
#
# This file configures how rheo compiles Typst documents in this project.

[compile]
# Exclude patterns for files that should not be compiled to output
# Supports glob patterns like "lib/**/*.typ" or "_*/**"
#
# Default: ["lib/**/*.typ"]
#
# Library/template files in the lib/ directory should be excluded since they:
# - Define reusable functions and templates
# - Are imported by other .typ files
# - Should not be compiled as standalone documents
exclude = ["lib/**/*.typ"]
