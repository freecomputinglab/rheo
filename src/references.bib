  abstract = {The definitive feminist analysis of reproductive and `caring' labor to emerge from Italian feminism of the 1970sEmerging from the great social upheavals that contested the sexual and racial divisions of labor globally in the 1970s, Leopoldina Fortunati's classic work expands and transforms how we analyze the sphere of reproduction, redefining the value of the individual's life and the labor performed in the home.Released here for the first time in its unabridged form with historical notation and contemporary commentary, The Arcana of Reproduction is a foundational text and essential contribution to today's discussions of social reproduction and the history of Italian feminism. Fortunati's work provides some of the earliest theorizations of `immaterial,' `affective,' and `caring' labor, and of the role of technology in reproduction, articulated decades before their popular reception in English academic literature.Reading this work some 50 years after its original publication gives us the tools to analyze the contemporary state of capitalist development and of women's lives today. The text remains prefigurative and essential in our era of digital labor.},

  abstract = {Marx for the twenty-first centuryThe first new English translation in fifty years---and the only one based on the last German edition revised by Marx himselfFeaturing extensive original commentary, including a foreword by acclaimed political theorist Wendy Brown``An astounding achievement.''---China Mi{\'e}ville, author of October: The Story of the Russian RevolutionKarl Marx (1818--1883) was living in exile in England when he embarked on an ambitious, multivolume critique of the capitalist system of production. Though only the first volume saw publication in Marx's lifetime, it would become one of the most consequential books in history. This magnificent new edition of Capital is a translation of Marx for the twenty-first century. It is the first translation into English to be based on the last German edition revised by Marx himself, the only version that can be called authoritative, and it features extensive commentary and annotations by Paul North and Paul Reitter that draw on the latest scholarship and provide invaluable perspective on the book and its complicated legacy. At once precise and boldly readable, this translation captures the momentous scale and sweep of Marx's thought while recovering the elegance and humor of the original source.For Marx, our global economic system is relentlessly driven by ``value''---to produce it, capture it, trade it, and, most of all, to increase it. Lifespans are shortened under the demand for ever-greater value. Days are lengthened, work is intensified, and the division of labor deepens until it leaves two classes, owners and workers, in constant struggle for life and livelihood. In Capital, Marx reveals how value came to tyrannize our world, and how the history of capital is a chronicle of bloodshed, colonization, and enslavement.With a foreword by Wendy Brown and an afterword by William Clare Roberts, this is a critical edition of Capital for our time, one that faithfully preserves the vitality and directness of Marx's German prose and renders his ideas newly relevant to modern readers.},

  abstract = {In this ambitious book, Moishe Postone undertakes a fundamental reinterpretation of Marx's mature critical theory. He calls into question many of the presuppositions of traditional Marxist analyses and offers new interpretations of Marx's central arguments. These interpretations lead him to a very different analysis of the nature and problems of capitalism and provide the basis for a critique of "actually existing socialism." According to this new interpretation, Marx identifies the central core of the capitalist system with an impersonal form of social domination generated by labor itself and not simply with market mechanisms and private property. Proletarian labor and the industrial production process are characterized as expressions of domination rather than as means of human emancipation. This reformulation relates the form of economic growth and the structure of social labor in modern society to the alienation and domination at the heart of capitalism. It provides the foundation for a critical social theory that is more adequate to late twentieth-century capitalism.},

With every click and scroll, we labor like serfs to increase its power. Welcome to technofeudalism . . .Perhaps we were too distracted by the pandemic, or the endless financial crises, or the rise of TikTok. But under cover of them all, a new and more exploitative system has been taking hold. Insane sums of money that were supposed to re-float our economies after the crash of 2008 went to big tech instead. With it they funded the construction of their private cloud fiefdoms and privatized the internet. Technofeudalism says Yanis Varoufakis, is the new power that is reshaping our lives and the world, and is the greatest current threat to the liberal individual, to our efforts to avert climate catastrophe---and to democracy itself. It also lies behind the new geopolitical tensions, especially the New Cold War between the United States and China.Drawing on stories from Greek myth and pop culture, from Homer to Mad Men, Varoufakis explains this revolutionary transformation: how it enslaves our minds, how it rewrites the rules of global power, and, ultimately, what it will take overthrow it.},
