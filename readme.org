** Building documents
rheo is a tool for flowing Typst documents into publishable outputs such as PDF, HTML, and EPUB.
To install the compilation environment, first ensure that you have [[https://nixos.org/download/][Nix]] installed on your computer.
Then run:

#+begin_src bash
nix develop
#+end_src

This might take a while the first time, as Nix is installing typst from upstream and all the other necessary software.

Once you have a shell prompt, you can run compile commands with [[https://github.com/casey/just][just]].
The default command compiles all .typ files to both PDF and HTML.

#+begin_src fish
# compile all documents to PDF/HTML
just

# compile a single document to PDF/HTML
just convert 0.introduction.typ
#+end_src

The typst we are using builds directly from the upstream GitHub, as HTML generation is a feature in progress.
To update the version of typst to the latest code on the ~main~ branch, run:

#+begin_src bash
just update 
#+end_src
