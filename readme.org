* rheo
rheo is a static site and experimental typesetting engine based on Typst.
It provides first-class support for both HTML and PDF, and experimental support for EPUB.

** Installation

*** Using Nix Flakes (Recommended)
To install the compilation environment, first ensure that you have [[https://nixos.org/download/][Nix]] installed on your computer.
You will also need to enable [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes][Nix flakes]], which you can do by inserting the following line in your ~nix.conf~:
#+begin_src conf
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
#+end_src

With Nix and flakes installed, you should be able to now run:

#+begin_src bash
# Enter development environment
nix develop

# Or build the package
nix build
#+end_src

This might take a while the first time, as Nix is installing typst from upstream and all the other necessary software.

*** Using Cargo
rheo requires Rust and Cargo. Install from [[https://rustup.rs/][rustup.rs]].

#+begin_src bash
# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Install locally
cargo install --path .
#+end_src

** Usage

rheo is a command-line tool for compiling Typst documents to PDF and HTML.

*** Compile a Project

Compile all =.typ= files in a directory to both PDF and HTML:

#+begin_src bash
rheo compile examples/web_book
#+end_src

Compile to specific formats:

#+begin_src bash
# PDF only
rheo compile examples/web_book --pdf

# HTML only
rheo compile examples/web_book --html
#+end_src

Output is organized by project: =build/{project}/pdf/= and =build/{project}/html/=.

*** Clean Build Artifacts

Remove build artifacts for the current project:

#+begin_src bash
rheo clean
#+end_src

Remove all build artifacts:

#+begin_src bash
rheo clean --all
#+end_src

Note: The =build/.gitignore= file is preserved during cleanup.

*** Logging

Control output verbosity:

#+begin_src bash
# Quiet mode (errors only)
rheo compile examples/web_book --quiet

# Verbose mode (debug information)
rheo compile examples/web_book --verbose

# Trace-level logging with RUST_LOG
RUST_LOG=rheo=trace rheo compile examples/web_book
#+end_src

** Project Structure

Each project folder can contain its own =.typ= files, =style.css=, =img/= directory, and =references.bib=.
All =.typ= files in the project directory (and subdirectories) will be compiled.

rheo automatically injects the following at the beginning of each main =.typ= file:

#+begin_src typst
#import "/src/typst/rheo.typ": *
#show: rheo_template
#+end_src

** Development

The typst we are using builds directly from the upstream GitHub, as HTML generation is a feature in progress.

*** Development Commands

#+begin_src bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check for issues
cargo clippy
#+end_src
